# FitHub

Next Steps:
adding workout tracking (i.e. user will be able to add
[{dips: [{BW, 10reps}, {BW, 10reps}, {BW, 10reps}]}, {bench: [{185lbs, 10reps}, {185lbs, 10reps}, {225lbs, 4reps}]}])
)

Future:
social-mdeia-esque feed with new PR postings, motivational quotes, workout/form tips, memes, apparel/supplement suggestions/deals

Way future:
workout suggestions(ML) based on yours and other user's past data
input: time limit, muscle group (given data: last rest day, past workout times)
output: broken down workout with [editable] weight/rep suggestions
